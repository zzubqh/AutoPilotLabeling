# Quick Start üöÄ

#### 1. Install npm
+ Linux: `sudo apt-get install npm`
+ Windows: https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.15.0/node-v10.15.0-x86.msi
+ Mac: https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac

#### 2. Clone repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/zzubqh/AutoPilotLabeling.git
```
#### 3. Install required python packages:
```shell
conda create -n 3d-bat python==3.11.3
conda activate 3d-bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
conda install -c conda-forge nodejs==10.13.0
